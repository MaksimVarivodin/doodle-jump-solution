Before you open the project I want to warn you, that there are a lot of bugs :)
If you are not ready to get emotional damage, don't open this)

About the installation: this project was built for Windows x32/x64 systems. All libraries and files for app are loaded automatically.
(more info at "project->properties->build events -> pre-build events" and "post-build events" if you are in VS).

Next what I want to tell is main principles of the app.

Main thing in the app is frames per rate. Using the ellapsed time most math is calculated.

Framework was given as a part of test task, so I "plugged it in" the project.
